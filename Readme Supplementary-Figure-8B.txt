Python Approach:

The Python code uses the func_e library to perform the enrichment analysis.

Input files:

Background file: Contains the list of all possible terms.

Query file: Contains the list of upregulated genes or features.

Terms file: Contains the mapping between terms and genes/features.

Terms to features file: Contains the gene set information for each term.

The analysis will be run with a p-value cutoff (ecut) of 0.05.

The results are stored in the specified output folder.

Command-Line Approach:

The command uses the FUNC-E tool to perform the enrichment analysis.

Input files are the same as for the Python approach.

The p-value cutoff (ecut) is set to 0.01 for this approach.

The results will be outputted to the specified folder.

Installation:
For the Python method, ensure that you have the func-e package installed. You can do this by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install func-e
Running the Analysis:
For Python:

Run the Python script provided with the appropriate file paths to your data.

The results will be saved to the output folder you specify in the script.

For Command Line:

Ensure the FUNC-E tool is installed and available in the specified path.

Execute the command line command with the correct paths to your files and set the output directory.

Output:
The analysis will provide:

Enrichment results for each term.

Statistical significance based on the p-value cutoff.

The output files will be stored in the specified output folder for further analysis.
