# Volcano Plot for WT vs. Mock in Marchantia

## Overview
This script generates a **volcano plot** to visualize differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between **Wild-Type (WT)** and **Mock-treated** samples in *Marchantia*. The script reads the DESeq2 output file and highlights significantly upregulated and downregulated genes.

## Features
- **Reads differential gene expression data from a CSV file**
- **Highlights significantly differentially expressed genes (p-adjusted < 0.05, |log2FoldChange| ≥ 2)**
- **Customizable color scheme for better visualization**
- **Adjustable x-axis and y-axis limits**
- **Threshold markers for easy interpretation**

## Dependencies
Ensure the following R packages are installed:
```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("ggrepel")  # Optional, for better label positioning
